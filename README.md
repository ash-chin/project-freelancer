# Project Freelancer
<p>Freelancer is a browser based game developed for the CIS 410 Game Programming course at University of Oregon by Ash Chin, Zacree Carroll and Tammas Hicks in Spring 2021.
  
  The game has the player take on the role of a freelance photographer in the far future who fulfills "photo bounties" to fund their space travels. We wanted to create a meditative and relaxing experience that rewarded players for improving their flight skills and familiarity with the environment over subsequent play sessions. We attempted to design a rogue-like gameplay loop, with the idea that players flight skills and knowledge of the map would improve over each play session, allowing them to discover new and interesting sights.</p>
